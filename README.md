blair-walden-project
====================

The Blair Walden Project: in 1845 Henry David Thoreau went to live in the woods... a year later his journal was found.

This repo is the home of a collaborative writing project, a mash-up of Walden and The Blair Which Project, in which it turns out that Thoreau wasn't alone in the woods after all.

The real reason for this project is to allow people learning to use Git to fork a repo, modify it, and generate a pull request.  It is used in the modified version of Git Pro by Allen B. Downey, available at https://github.com/AllenDowney/progit
